# Mega Man 2 Password Generator #

## Overview ##

[Mega Man 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_2), like many games of its era, utilized a password system in order to
continue your progress between game sessions. This removed the need for a battery in the game catridge and allowed gamers
to share passwords (and thus progress) with others.

In Mega Man 2, the password is represented as a 5x5 grid in which the columns are labled 1-5 and the rows A-E. Each password
is composed of 9 cells which are 'set', indicated by a red dot.

Thus, a password can be communicated as A5, B2, B4, C1, C3, C5, D4, D5, E2.

Put another way, this 5x5 grid represents 25 bits in which a password always has exactly 9 bits set. Using this representation,
the password algorithm can be expressed succinctly in terms of these bits and using basic
[bitwise operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation).

In the 25 bits, there are 5 words of 5 bits each where each word represents a row in the grid. The entire 25-bit password
is thus comprised of the words A E D C B (using little endian). So, the first word (lowest 5 bits) are the 5 bits of the row B
and the last word (bits 20-25) are the 6 bits of row A.

### Words 1-4 (bits 1-20) ###

A Mega Man 2 password has exactly 9 bits set. 8 of these bits represent the alive/defeated status of each of the
[8 bosses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Master#009-016_.28Mega_Man_2.29) in the game. The follow table illustrates the bit
values for the alive/defeated status for each of the 8 bosses.

Boss       | Alive | Defeated
---------- | ----- | --------
Bubble Man | C3    | D1
Air Man    | D2    | E3
Quick Man  | C4    | B4
Wood Man   | B5    | D3
Crash Man  | E2    | C5
Flash Man  | E4    | C1
Metal Man  | E1    | E5
Heat Man   | D5    | B2

Thus, if both Bubble Man and Air Man were defeated but all other bosses were still alive, this is represented as the following
bits (1-20) 01111 10001 01000 10000.

Row  | E     | D     | C     | B
---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | -----
Word | 01111 | 10001 | 01000 | 10000

### E-Tank Word (bits 21-25) ###

The last bit (9th) represents the number of E-Tanks Mega Man has. This is stored in the 5th word (row A) and represents bits
21-25, the most significant bits of the password. Mega Man can have between 0-4 E-Tanks and this is encoded simply per the bit
position in this last word. Thus, if Mega Man has 0 E-Tanks the word is 00001, 1 E-Tank is 00010, 2 E-Tanks is 00100, and so
forth. Unlike the other words, the 5th word (row A) will thus only ever have a single bit set.

The E-Tank word (row A) is important in that it encodes bits 1-20 by performing a
[rotate left operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift) on bits 1-20 by the number of E-Tanks that Mega Man has.
Thus, if Mega Man has 2 E-Tanks, bits 1-20 are rotated left by 2 positions. If Mega Man has 0 E-Tanks, this is effectively a no-op.
The table above illustrating the bits set for each of the 8 bosses represent the bits prior to the rotate left operation. The bits
of the E-Tank word are not included in the left rotation.

## Algorithm ##

The algorithm for calculating a password can be summarized as follows:

1. Set the bits of the first 4 words (rows B, C, D, E) based on the table above (bits 1-20)
2. Rotate left bits 1-20 based on the number of E-Tanks
3. Add the E-Tank word (bits 21-25) as the most significant word of the password

## Setup ##

To run mm2pwd you will need [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed.
mm2pwd has been tested with Ruby 1.9.3p362 which is the latest version as of this writing.

## Running ##

To run mm2pwd, simply open a terminal session in the root directory and execute the following command:

    $ ./mm2pwd.rb

Without an modification, this will generate a password in which Mega Man has all 4 E-Tanks and has defeated all 8 bosses. If you
want to modify this, simply change the values in the initialize method.
